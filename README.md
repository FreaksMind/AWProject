# WadoApp: Ontology-Driven Software Knowledge System

## Overview
WadoApp is a web application that leverages GitHub’s GraphQL API to extract, structure, and analyze public software repositories. Using OWL (Web Ontology Language), it models key aspects of web application development, including programming paradigms, languages, architectures, and software tools.

## Features
- 🧠 **Ontology-Driven Model**: Uses and extends existing ontologies for structured knowledge representation.
- 🔍 **GraphQL Integration**: Extracts data from GitHub repositories.
- 🛠 **Semantic Processing**: Employs Flask and rdflib for ontology management.
- 💻 **Interactive UI**: Built with Vue.js for intuitive browsing and querying.
- 🤖 **Intelligent Querying**: Enables reasoning and knowledge discovery in software ecosystems.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Semantic Processing**: rdflib
- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Data Source**: GitHub GraphQL API
- **Ontology Modeling**: OWL

## Use Case
This system allows developers and researchers to explore software development trends, manage structured knowledge, and support intelligent queries and recommendations.

## Future Scope
Potential applications in software analysis, recommendations, and intelligent development tools.
